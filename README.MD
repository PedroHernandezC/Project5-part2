# Project 5 -- Part 2 -- Hash Tables and the LRU profile
## Student Information: 
**Name**: Pedro Hernandez Carranza 

**Student ID**: 008806974

## Reflection
- Collaboration & Sources: 
  - Many of the other students asked some very important questions regarding what should be changed and kept the same. Your responses to them was a great help and assured me I was on the right path.
  - This Project heavily relied on the understanding of the first part and required us to re-implement the same testing approach.
  - I used in AI in figuring out how to compile the program from the command line. While in development I used Clion's Cmake tools to run the programs.
  - The solution provided by the professor for lab 12 were incredibly helpful in understanding different takeaways from the data that were not immediately apparent. 
- Implementation Details:
  - Compiling harness/main.cpp
  - Navigate to the root of the project.
  - Run the following to compile: g++ -std=c++17 -o harness main.cpp HashTableDictionary.cpp
  - Execute the following to generate traces: ./harness

- Testing & Status:
  - I used the given trace files and professor provided examples to see if my harness was creating the expected output. I also compared the gnerated graphs shape to the theoretical nlogn shape 

- I was unable to complete a trac generator so all of its files have been removed to help prevent confusion
